# TaskerMAN

Installing TaskerMAN is a fairly simple process. First you need to clone the git respository into a directory which is accessible by your webserver. This can be done using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/aber-cs22120-group-15/TaskerMAN.git`

Then you need to copy `config/config.php.tmp` to `config/config.php` and edit in your MySQL connection details. 

Once this is done, you can open a web browser and browse to the path in which you placed the code. This will then cause the installer to display where you can create a first administrative user. Once that is done, the application is installed!
